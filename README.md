<p align="center" style="font-weight: 700;font-size: 24px;">A <i>Software Engineer</i> based in the United States</p>

I'm interested in all aspects of software development. Recently, my passion lies in the web application development including both the front end and the back end. I fell in love with the modern **JavaScript**.

Since I was a senior in college, I've liked mobile wireless networks as well. Therefore, I have read new telecommunication technologies such as next generation wireless networks.

Outside the realm of computers, I enjoy car detailing as a car enthusiast. I research how to make the car cleaner. I also like traveling all over the world. One of my dreams is to visit all the national parks in the United States.
