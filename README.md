A _Software Engineer_ based in the United States.

I'm interested in all aspects of software development. Recently, my passion lies in the web application development including both the front end and the back end. I fell in love with the modern **JavaScript**.

Since I was a senior in college, I've liked mobile wireless networks as well. Therefore, I have read new telecommunication technologies such as next generation wireless networks.

Outside the realm of computers, I enjoy car detailing as a car enthusiast. I research how to make the car cleaner. I also like traveling all over the world. One of my dreams is to visit all the national parks in the United States.
